The app is called Fantasy Football Trader. ESPN recently launched a service on their fantasy platform that suggests trades using IBM Watson. Once fully developed, this app should do that even better, as well as evaluate manually created trades. It will do this using player fantasy point projections.

The app uses default React packages (“react”, “react-native”, “react-navigation”), as well as packages to read excel files (“xlsx” and “read-excel-file”)
